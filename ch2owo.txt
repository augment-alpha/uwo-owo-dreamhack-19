<<>> I decide to go to the front and sit next to owo.
<<>> His personality was so welcoming earlier. I feel more comfortable sitting next to owo more than uwu.
<<>> As I sit down on the chair owo looks up at me.
<<owo>> “Oh my gosh! My savior is here!!! You’re doing the hackathon??”
<<main>> “Yes! Is that why you brought your computer in earlier today?”
<<owo>> “Well.. actually it’s for a more specific reason… but yes another reason is that I’m participating in the hackathon as well.”
<<>> He’s being secretive.
<<>> I didn’t expect that of owo, he seemed so open earlier.
<<owo>> “Say… do you watch youtube? Who do you support, Pewdiepie or T-series?”
<<>> .. that’s random..
<<>> Alright I support..
--- if pewdiepie --- +1 good
<<owo>> “I knew you were a cool girl.”
<<>> I blush at his praise.
<<owo>> “He lost recently to T-Series you know that right?”
<<main>> “Yes, I’ve kept up to date with the battle.”
<<owo>> “Well then it seems like you actually are a fan. Then I’ll tell you something not a lot of people know.”
<<main>> “What is it?”
<<owo>> “Martzia left him for the founder of T-Series not long after the battle was over.”
<<>> I’m absolutely shocked by this news. Their relationships must have been on the rocks for a while.
<<main>> “That’s awful… I hope pewdiepie is doing ok.”
<<owo>> “I’m sure he’s doing just fine.”
<<>> The people who run Version Alpha start talking about the hackathon. 
<<>> owo and I tune in to listen to the rules.

<<>> owo looks as if he’s about to cry.
<<owo>> “You too huh… for some reason I thought you were different.”
<<>> What does he mean by that?
<<owo>> “Never mind about that…”
<<>> The people who run Version Alpha start talking about the hackathon. 
<<>> owo and I tune in to listen to the rules.

<<>> owo and I decided to team up together for the hackathon.
<<>> We created a prototype for a youtuber simulator.
<<>> I had a great time working with owo. He’s so open and kind.
<<>> Receiving praise from him makes me blush.
<<>> After the hackathon owo asked to speak with me.
<<owo>> “To tell you the truth <name>… I have a secret.”
<<>> I look at him, very intrigued. I wonder if this was what he was hiding earlier. 
<<owo>> “I’m pewdiepie undercover.”
<<>> I look at him alarmed. 
<<>> I start to feel nervous.
<<owo>> “Hey. I’m still owo and you’re still my savior.”
<<>> That makes me feel a bit better. I see the resemblance. 
--show owo face on pewdiepie-
<<owo>> “That’s not all I wanted to talk to you about.”
<<main>> “Oh? What else is there owo?”
<<owo>> “I had a great time with you at the hackathon today. I’ve been down for a while because of some personal events. Getting to know you really cheers me up.. and well.. I would like to see more of you.”
<<>> Is he asking me out??
<<>> owo is so cool and sweet. I would love to get to know him even better. It also seems like we get along well from our interaction so far. 
<<owo>> “Well?”
<<>> owo looks down a bit timid and then looks back up at me.
<<main>> “I would love to owo. We could play some games together sometime or something. “
<<>> owo smiles. He’s so personable but he also has a bit of shy side. It’s attractive that he’s not full of himself as he’s so famous on the internet.
<<>> I guess I’m an owo-girl.
<<owo>> “It’s a date. Okay~ Savior lets take a photo together to celebrate our first game.”
<<main>> “Okay I would love to!”

<<>> After the team building owo disappeared.
<<>> I have no clue where he went.
<<>> I didn’t make a team with owo. So, I combined forces with some random people.
<<>> We did ok. The hackathon wasn’t what I dreamed of, but I’m glad to have gotten more experience in the gaming industry.
<<>> I didn’t really get close to anyone. I guess I’m pretty content with being alone with my computer forever.
